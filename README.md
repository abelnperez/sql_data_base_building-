## Main goal  ðŸ“¼ðŸ“¼ðŸ“¼

Our client is a nostalgic business man who has open a reatro Arcade games salon for those who were kids in the 70Â´s and 80Â´s. The business is going well, it has a strong base of loyal clients and the salon is very popular in the area, atracting people form other cities when they organice the Arcade Contest every month. Since the business is going well, the owner has had the idea to add something new and at the same time old to itÂ´s business. 

To include more retro taste to the Arcade Salon he has bought the films inventary of the last Blockbuster videoclub in the city, which closed in 2006, more than 17 years ago. With the movies he was also able to obtain the last Data Base of the videoclub, and his idea is to recover it as well and put it runiing again. Since everything in his business is retro, he is looking to mantain the records of the last clients (except the personal data, since it is protected by law) as a sign of continuity. 

So I have gathered all the important information in the old csvÂ´s, to btain a clean, organized, null-free and legible data set that allows us to read and interpret the information we need and is relevant to us. Once that part is done I have created an structured Data Base in SQL that will help the owner to manage the business.
